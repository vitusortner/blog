I'm doing front-end development and from time to time I write about it.
At the moment, I'm working as an Android engineer at SoundCloud in Berlin, Germany.

Some of my current interests lie somewhere between the concepts behind declarative UI and advocating the usage of relational databases on mobile clients while embracing the differences of the relational and object-oriented paradigms.
I work on [open-source projects](https://github.com/vitusortner) and maintain a [SQLite abstraction library](https://github.com/vitusortner/floor) used by cross-platform applications.
Besides the technology-related things, I love musically accompanied summer night bike rides.
