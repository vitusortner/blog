I'm doing front-end development with statically-typed languages and from time to time I write about it.
At the moment, I'm working as an Android developer in Berlin, Germany.

My current interests lie in the concepts of building UI declaratively and, on the other end of the spectrum, advocating the usage of relational databases on mobile clients while embracing the differences of the relational and object-oriented paradigms.
I work on [open-source projects](https://github.com/vitusortner) and maintain a [SQLite abstraction library](https://github.com/vitusortner/floor) used by mobile applications.
